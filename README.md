## Installation

### From the ZIP file and GUI interface

* Download a release package from https://github.com/NDUWRDC/LIMS/releases
* Log into Dolibarr as admininistrator and browse to ```Home - Setup - Modules/Applications```
  * Select tab ```Deploy/install external app/module```
  * Select the zip-file (release package) and click SEND

Note: If you get a message 'no custom directory', check if your setup is correct:

- In your Dolibarr installation directory, edit the ```htdocs/conf/conf.php``` file and check that following lines are not commented:

    ```php
    //$dolibarr_main_url_root_alt ...
    //$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt ...
    ```

- Uncomment them if necessary (delete the leading ```//```) and assign a sensible value according to your Dolibarr installation

    For example :

    - UNIX:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = '/var/www/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

    - Windows:
        ```php
        $dolibarr_main_url_root_alt = '/custom';
        $dolibarr_main_document_root_alt = 'C:/My Web Sites/Dolibarr/htdocs/custom';
        ```

### From a GIT repository

- Clone the repository in ```$dolibarr_main_document_root_alt/lims```

```sh
cd ....../custom
git clone https://github.com/NDUWRDC/LIMS.git lims 
```

### <a name="final_steps"></a>Final steps
